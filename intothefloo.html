		<div id="page_description"><h2>Into the Floo</h2>
			My name is Mona Morsy, founder of Into the Floo, and I've been under the spell of the Harry Potter Trading Card Game since I was 14 years old. It all started with a blister pack gifted to me by my mother. I remember it being marked down with a bright orange sale sticker on it, which must  have been from Kmart, Kohl’s or Target. Inside was a Base Set booster pack that, once opened, unlocked a world I never wanted to leave. I carefully tucked those cards into a binder, flipping through them often like pages of the Harry Potter books. That simple gift became the seed to a lifelong passion. 
			</br></br>
While my collection journey has had its ebb and flow, I’ve been fully committed for the past 10 years in tracking down rare cards, ultra-limited items and even one of a kind artifacts from the games vault. Along the way, I’ve had the privilege of meeting some great people who worked on the game and had first hand experience in bringing this beloved game to life! 
</br></br>
Into The Floo is a way for me to keep this magic alive and share it with fellow collectors, players and fans of the game who still believe in the wonder of it all.

		On my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTMre4I9GDWr4oPqBBCPZqA">YouTube channel</a>, I deep dive into the world of the Harry Potter TCG, as well as vintage Harry Potter merchandise from the early 2000’s. In these videos you'll find unboxing, collector tips, history of the game, deck techs, recorded gameplay from the ITF Discord server, as well as interviews by original illustrators and employees who worked on the game all those years ago.    
		</br></br>
In recent months, I decided to take the ITF brand and bring it to the physical world with the Into The Floo: A Harry Potter TCG Magazine created for both veteran players/collectors and new fans alike. In these pages, you will find articles written by me and other HPTCG collectors from around the globe. Articles are written about the game itself, gameplay, deck techs, top 10 card lists,  interviews, unpublished artwork and more!

		<p>
			After working for months with Keith Garletts, original illustrator for the HPTCG, we designed this incredible piece that Kieth painted as a playmat for the game! If the game never met its demise, I know we would have had playmats galore. Since we never got to witness that, I wanted to bring that to the community with the help of an original illustrator who knew first hand the design aspects and style of the game. This is currently in production, and most orders have already been made. With some issues with printing, I had to go with a different company so there may be a few spare. If you want one, contact me on IG!
